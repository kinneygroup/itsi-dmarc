### Services
DMARC monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of email security and policy enforcement:

1. DMARC Monitoring
    * Description: Centralized monitoring of DMARC policies and their enforcement across email domains.
2. Email Domain
    * Description: Monitoring the domains from which emails claim to originate.
3. Authentication Mechanisms
    * Description: Monitoring the mechanisms used to authenticate emails, including SPF and DKIM.
4. Report Analysis
    * Description: Analyzing DMARC aggregate and forensic reports to identify trends and anomalies.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Domain Spoofing Attempts
    * Description: Number of emails failing DMARC checks due to domain spoofing.
2. Delivery Error Rate
    * Description: Percentage of emails that failed to be delivered.
3. SPF Authentication Success Rate
    * Description: Percentage of emails passing SPF checks.
4. DKIM Authentication Success Rate
    * Description: Percentage of emails passing DKIM checks.
5. Aggregate Report Count
    * Description: Number of DMARC aggregate reports received.
6. Forensic Report Count
    * Description: Number of DMARC forensic reports received.
7. Policy Enforcement Rate
    * Description: Percentage of emails subjected to DMARC policy actions (none, quarantine, reject).
8. Bounce Rate
    * Description: Percentage of emails that bounced back.
9. Volume Spike Detection
    * Description: Detection of unusual spikes in email volume.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, DMARC Monitoring is dependent on the Email Domain, Authentication Mechanisms, and Report Analysis services. Similarly, Email Domain relies on Delivery Status and Volume to detect anomalies and ensure proper domain usage.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Authentication Mechanisms depending on SPF and DKIM Authentication, illustrating a layered approach to email security where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
